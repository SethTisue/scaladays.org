								<h2>Functional Patterns for the Asynchronous Web</h2>
								<p>Asynchronous programming is the latest hype for web development.  While Asynchronous programming can help improve total throughput on a multi-core machine, the current state of the art lacks common patterns for how to define asynchronous flow.<br/><br/>This talk covers those patterns, from joining together a series of asynchronous operations to chaining a pipeline of asynchronous tasks.  We’ll present a few core abstractions (applicative functors, monads, traversal) that help define asynchronous workflow and then use these same abstractions to test the same flows synchronously.</p>

								<h2>A Walk Down the Beach, How Kiama Helps Implementing Distributed Collections on Top of Hadoop</h2>
								<p>
									This talk will give you an brief overview of the BigData tooling landscape and where Scoobi, a distributed collection Scala library for Hadoop, stands.
									Then we'll see what are the challenges in translating Scoobi abstractions to Hadoop constructs and how Scala, as programming language, and Kiama (<a href="http://code.google.com/kiama">http://code.google.com/kiama</a>), as a graph-processing library, can be leveraged to support this translation.
									In particular, we'll show:<br/>
									- How rewriting rules based on partial functions are a very succinct way to pre-process the computation graph and to optimise it.<br/>
									- How attribute grammars can be used to implement general graph traversal algorithms<br/>

								<h2>Simple API Design, Lessons Learned</h2>
								<p>
									Scala is one of the most feature rich, expressive and flexible languages around at present. It offers more ways to solve a problem than virtually any other language around, since it mixes Object Orientation, Functional Programming, Static Typing and much more.<br/>
									The down side of all this power and functionality is all too commonly observable in the libraries available for Scala. Many libraries forget the audience for whom they are being written, and instead expose details like the underlying model (which may be very clever, but should mostly be orthogonal to the resulting API and certainly should not directly affect it). To put it another way, if your database structure dictates your user interface or web page, something is wrong with the design of your site (too many failed model driven design projects back this assertion). In the same way, APIs that are dictated by the innermost workings of your library have likely failed to take into account the needs of the user.<br/>
									While writing SubCut, and further enhancing the feature set for SubCut 2.0, I learned many lessons about the advantages of teasing apart your semantic model from your library API. This is not a talk about SubCut, but a talk about some of the techniques I used to provide what I believe is the smallest, simplest and most streamlined API, while hiding most of the details of the implementation. I can also speak to the advantage of that approach with the enhancements made in SubCut 2.0 - the small targeted API let me change much about the inner workings, and while the API was affected for some new features, the new features were always added in a way that kept the API familiar to current users, and more importantly provided an easy, often non-breaking transition path.

								<h2>Scalable and Flexible Machine Learning With Scala</h2>
								<p>
									Machine learning (ML) turns data into predictions about the real world in an almost magical fashion. In this talk we'll show why Scala is a great language for machine learning practitioners and show the audience of Scala programmers how easy it is to start performing machine learning magic themselves.<br/>
									Machine learning enthusiasts have historically preferred high-level programming languages due to their ability to concisely describe models and algorithms, but this has often come at the price of performance and production readiness. For example, the ease of rapid prototyping and syntactic sugar of Python have made it a popular choice for ML developers. Scala combines this flexibility with the strengths of the JVM such as performance and seamless interoperability with the mature ecosystem of existing Java software. In this talk we will show how Scala DSLs can improve the effectiveness of machine learning practitioners and even make machine learning capabilities accessible to people without a Scala background.<br/>
									Scalding has a Hadoop-based DSL that allows code using regular Scala collections to be run as Hadoop jobs with almost no modification. We will show how machine learning code written in terms of operations over Scala collections can therefore be made to work immediately on giant compute clusters over terabytes of data. We will also briefly discuss how Scalding works in order to show how DSLs can be designed in Scala.

								<h2>Confessions of a Ruby Developer Whose Heart Was Stolen by Scala</h2>
								<p>
									Ruby has a long history of "making the developer happy" by allowing for ease of programming and prototyping. Rails has taken off by storm and allowed startup companies to quickly create web applications that solve features required by the business. However, recently the Ruby community has realized that scaling Ruby in the real world can be a challenge due to the lack of type safety, the global interpreter lock, lack of a robust threading library, and the general lack of focus on performance in the Ruby world.<br/>
									<br/>
									In this talk my goal will be to illustrate how I've made the transition from the dynamic programming world of Ruby to the type safe and highly async/concurrent world of Scala and Akka. I think that Ruby developers shy away from Scala due to its static type safety and lack of understanding of its powerful and expressive features. I want to illustrate how Scala does a much better job at allowing the developer to be expressive while avoiding common pitfalls with Ruby (e.g., Ruby's dynamic mixins vs. Scala's type safe trait mixins). I will use examples from my own redis_failover project and illustrate how using Scala could've saved me at times.<br/>
									<br/>
									The Ruby/Rails community currently has a huge force behind it, and I think that some of these users will make the transition to Scala/Akka/Play with the proper illustrative comparisons and knowledge.

									Jan will show how to use RabbitMQ to connect components on different platforms. After a few introductory slides explaining the main concepts, the rest of the talk will be live code. The coding will begin by showing simple Scala / Akka code to connect to RabbitMQ to send and receive messages--think ``java.lang.String`` values back and forth to start with. We will then increase the complexity of the messages and marshal the messages into JSON. Jan will then show the real power of messaging infrastructures by replacing the RPC server component by native code in C++: we will write image processing component. To make matters even better--faster--we will then use CUDA to perform the image processing.<br/>
									<br/>Come to Jan's talk and demo if you want to find out how to use Scala, Akka and RabbitMQ in the core of your application, especially if your application needs to tie together code on completely different platforms and if it performs heavy number crunching or image processing.

								<h2>Akka Typed Channels</h2>
								<p>The actor model has been established as an important tool for dealing with concurrency, parallelism and distribution, but it has one feature which seems at odds with Scala’s statically typed setting: the fundamental communication mechanism is dynamically typed. This talk presents typed channels implemented as an Akka extension: Scala 2.10's hygienic macros provide the same level of type-safety for actor interactions as is afforded by the type-checker for normal method invocations.</p>

								<h2>Taming the Cake Pattern with Type Macros</h2>
								<p>
									In this talk, we discuss some interesting extensions to the cake pattern as described in <a href="http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real­world­scala­dependency­injection­di">Real­World Scala: Dependency Injection (DI)</a> by Jonas Bonér. We consider the use of the cake pattern to express hierarchical components, and the high­level design constraints between them. We also discuss encapsulating the details of a composite component.<br/>
									<br/>
									The cake pattern suffers from three major problems that limit its adoption:<br/>
									1. Verbosity: Lots of boilerplate.<br/>
									2. Opacity: Hard to follow the code because the language idioms used do not signify the user's intent.<br/>
									3. Compiler error messages are confusing.<br/>
									<br/>
									We present a specification for a suite of type macros to address the problems of verbosity and opacity. We provide a status report on the implementation of these macros to date.

								<h2>Using Spring in Scala</h2>
								<p>The Spring Framework is one of the most popular Java frameworks used today. While it is possible to use Spring in Scala, it does feel awkward in certain places, because of the "Javaism" peering through. For instance, using callback interfaces feels strange in Scala; functions would be a better match. In October 2012, I introduced the Spring Scala project, which solves this particular issue, and aims to make it easier to use Spring in Scala in general. In this session, we discuss the Spring Scala portfolio project and its feature set.</p>

								<h2>How Scala and Akka helped build Sirius at Comcast's Interactive Media division</h2>
								<p>
									A case study of how Scala and Akka helped a team of software developers without a whole lot of distributed system programming experience build a fairly sophisticated, production quality distributed system with a custom multipaxos implementation at its core.  The name of the system is Sirius, and we're using it to power the next generation of our API layer at Comcast's Interactive Media division.<br/>
									<br/>
									The talk will focus on how we use'd Akka and Scala to build the core of the system.<br/>
									<br/>
									Our basic approach was to read up on all the Paxos literature we could find.  We then took the psuedocode in "Paxos Made Moderately Complex" and translated it wholesale into straightforward Scala using functions and tuples.  Then we slowly massaged that code into something cleaner using case classes before moving it into Akka actors.  Finally, we went through that naive implementation to optimize our usage of memory and network resources to finish the core Paxos implementation.<br/>
									<br/>
									We've had this running in production for about half a year now with only minor issues.  Given that we had very limited experience with distributed systems, this a major miracle that we couldn't have pulled off without Akka.

								<p>Asynchronous IO is one of the most important building blocks when designing high-performance systems. Over the years various patterns emerged on top of the selector based services provided by the operating system. In this talk I will give a quick overview of the most important asynchronous IO patterns from callbacks to iteratees, demonstrating various approaches to error handling, backpressure/throttling and exposing low level behavior. Finally I will show how these approaches map to the actor world, introducing the new IO model designed by the Akka and Spray team available in Akka 2.2."</p>

									Scala continues to be fun! Implementing algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles, bioinformatic problems, and analyzing time-series data has been a great learning experience. Creating video games and mods have made my game time much more enjoyable and gave me an opportunity to impress my friends! To do all these, I used a myriad of technologies from Scala IDE, sbt, and giter8 to git, Android, and Play! In the process, I learned a lot more about Scala's features such as traits, iterators, streams, lazy vals, implicit classes, and typeclasses.<br/>
									In this talk, I will share a few games, Android apps, and algorithms that show how Scala made implementing complex programs simple. I will also demonstrate a few awesome Minecraft mods written in Scala and a "mind blowing" project.

								<h2>Deciphering Maya Hieroglyphic Writing with Scala</h2>
								<p>The decipherment of Mesoamerican hieroglyphic writing systems advanced at previously unparalleled rates in recent decades. One of the keys to this success is the application of methodologies developed and applied successfully to other writing systems. The purpose of this presentation is to show how some of these methodologies, from Natural Language Processing and Hermeneumatics, can be successfully applied to the Maya hieroglyphic writing system thanks to the power and versatility of Scala. In particular, the research framework presented here makes extensive use of the facilities that Scala provides to build external Domain Specific Languages that epigraphers can use both to provide accurate transcriptions and transliterations of hieroglyphic texts, and to query the linguistic corpora for quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p>
