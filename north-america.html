							<h3>Scala Days North America</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>17-19 June: Workshops</li>
								<li>19-21 June: Conference Sessions</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Scala Days, the premier Scala conference, will be held this year at <a href="http://www.sheratonnewyork.com/" target="_blank">Sheraton New York Times Square</a> in New York on June 19-21, 2018. There will also be a <a href="http://eu.scaladays.org" target="_blank">Scala Days Europe</a> at the Kosmos Berlin on May 14-7, 2018.</p>
							<p>Scala Days brings together developers from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala and related technologies, like Spark, Kafka, and Akka. Scala Days provides a unique opportunity for Scala users to interact with the contributors to the language and related technologies and connect with fellow developers.</p>
							<p>The conference in New York will start on Tuesday, June 19, with an opening keynote by Martin Odersky and an evening event. More keynotes and conference talks will be given on Wednesday and Thursday, June 20 and 21. Pre-conference workshops will take place on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, June 17-19, 2018.</p>

										<h2>Martin Odersky</h2>
										<h3> Lightbend (Chair)</h3>
										<p>Martin Odersky is the inventor of the Scala language, a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and a founder of Lightbend. His work concentrates on the fusion of functional and object-oriented programming. He believes the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as possible. To prove this, he has worked on a number of language designs, from Pizza to GJ to Functional Nets. He has also influenced the development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the original author of the current javac reference compiler.</p>

							<h2>Diversity</h2>
							<p>The group of professional Scala developers is as diverse as the projects that spring from it. Since this also includes the innovation potential of the industry, we want this to be visible in our line-up. Diversity on the stage also leads to diversity in the long run and can thus give new impulses away from the lecture program.</p>
							<p>To this end, in the run-up to the conference we hold many discussions, we are always on the lookout for people with special expertise and are open to suggestions. And, we want to create an atmosphere of respect and certainty so that everyone has the same opportunity to be heard and to be involved. Therefore, it is important to us that speakers, exhibitors and conference participants adhere to our Code of Conduct. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this topic, please contact <a href="mailto:m@lightbend.com, schoenfeldt@dpunkt.de">René Schönfeldt and Markus Eisele</a>.</p>
