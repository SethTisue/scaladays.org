                <p>
                    The conference will bring together developers from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala and related technologies, like Akka and Play Framework. Scala Days provides a unique opportunity for Scala users to interact with the contributors to the language and related technologies and connect with fellow developers.

                <p>
                    Last year’s conferences in San Fancisco and Amsterdam were sold-out events! Leaders from Scala User Groups and communities around the globe, students and language contributors, will gather to discuss academic research, use-cases and visionary projects for a two day, action-packed event.

                                                        <p>Martin Odersky created the Scala programming language and is a professor in the programming research group at EPFL, the leading technical university in Switzerland. Throughout his career, Martin's singular objective has been to make the basic job of writing programs faster, easier and more enjoyable. In the process, he has personally written more lines of Java and Scala code than almost any other individual in the world. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today's Java programmers, and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in Scala," the best-selling book on Scala. Previously he has held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, University of Karlsruhe and University of South Australia, after having obtained his doctorate from ETH Zürich as a student of Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal.</p>

                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">Reactive Applications are the next major evolution of the Internet. They allow for applications to be responsive, scalable and resilient by building on a fully event-driven foundation. Lightbend’s Reactive Platform, consisting of the Play Framework, the Akka middleware and the Scala programming language embraces this new programming paradigm which allows developers to write interactive applications that are always available and which adapt to changing load by being distributed by design.</div>
                                                    <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">While the reactive approach enable us to build highly scalable and resilient applications it also introduces new challenges in how to monitor them. Almost every current monitoring tool relies on a stack frame based approach where using the stack trace can provide good answers to what caused the exceptional state. In message driven, or asynchronous, applications this approach no longer provides any good information. We therefore need to invent new approaches for how to monitor these types of applications. During this session we will cover the traditional monitoring approach, different possible ways of how to monitor asynchronous applications and finally show the way we have chosen to build a monitoring tool for reactive applications at&nbsp;Lightbend</div>

                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">It was true that, until pretty recently, the language of choice to manipulate and to make sense out of the data for Data Scientists was mainly one of Python, R or Matlab. This lead to split in the communities and duplication of efforts in languages offering a similar set functionnaiity.</div>
                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">Although, it was foreseen that Julia (for instance) could gather parts of these communities, an unexpected event happened: the amount of available data and the distributed technologies to handle them. Distributed technologies raised out of the blue by data engineer and most of them are using a convenient and easy to deploy platform, the JVM.</div>
                                                    <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">In this talk, we’ll show how the Data Scientists are now part of an heterogeneous team that has to face many problems and have to work towards a global solution together. This is including a new responsibility to be productive and agile in order to have their work integrated into the platform. This is why technologies like Apache Spark is so important nowadays and is gaining this traction from different communities. And even though some binding are available to legacy languages there, all the creativity in new ways to analyse the data has to be done in scala. So that, the second part of this talk will introduce and summarize all the new methodologies and scientific advances in machine learning done Scala as the main language, rather than others. We’ll demonstrate that all using the right tooling for Data Scientists which is enabling interactivity, live reactivity, charting capabilities and robustness in Scala, something there were still missing from the legacy languages. Hence, the examples will be provided and shown in a fully productive and reproducible environment combining the Spark Notebook and Docker.</div>

We are not, as we believe that building microservices today is more challenging than it should be. Lagom&nbsp;is here to take on this challenge. First, Lagom&nbsp;is opinionated and it will take some of the hard decisions for you, guiding you to produce microservices that adheres to the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Reactive </a>tenents. Second, Lagom&nbsp;was built from the ground up around you, the developer, to push your productivity to the next level. If you are familiar with the Play Framework's development environment, imagine that but tuned for building microservices; we are sure you are going to love it! Third, Lagom&nbsp;comes with batteries included for deploying in production: going from development to production could not be easier. In this session, you will get an introduction to the Lightbend&nbsp;Lagom&nbsp;framework. There will be code and live demos to show you in practice how it works and what you can do with it, making you fully equipped to build your next microservices with Lightbend&nbsp;Lagom!</p>

At the intersection between Scala's syntactic versatility and its reliable type-level constraints, there exists a narrow window of opportunity for designing APIs that are both expressive and safe; for writing code that is elegant.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>We will explore this unique "elegance zone" offered by Scala, with useful real-world examples from Rapture, a collection of libraries for familiar everyday programming tasks, such as working with JSON, XML, HTML and CSV, time, internationalization, logging and I/O. Rapture's philosophy is to drive forwards the state of the art in typesafety, whilst at the same time maintaining the most intuitive syntax.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>Ultimately, we will show that features of Scala like implicits and type inference offer some very exciting possibilities for developing software that provides both clearer code and offers more static guarantees, and that writing elegant code in Scala is within everyone's grasp—this is Scala's great chance to outshine other languages!</dd>

                                                    <p>Imagine a world where writing and maintaining build scripts is fun and not black magic. A world without axis-scoped-multi-config-multi-project builds. With fast dependency resolution. Intuitive and statically checked build configuration. Where large builds use few and simple building blocks to compose small, self-contained and easy to understand builds. Where you only need to learn a small Scala library nothing more. Welcome to CBT - fun, fast, intuitive, composable, statically checked builds written in Scala. This is not a prototype. It's ready for prime time. This talk gets you started writing your own CBT builds. We'll do live coding and explain the philosophy behind CBT. If time permits, we'll dive into CBT's actually small and easy to understand code base.</p>

But we will show how more expressive type systems can be used to drive novel powerful optimizations and make the program faster. Based on this principle, we built the Dotty Linker, a whole-program optimizer that represents a breakthrough in optimization of Scala code. We will demonstrate how the linker is capable of reducing the performance overhead of commonly-used Scala features such as generic methods and classes, lazy vals, implicit conversions and closures.</div>

                                                    <p>In the past year, all of my projects have involved using Scala with some moving entity: musical notes, robots, garage doors, and so on. In this talk, I will show how Scala has been consistently helpful, no matter what I throw at it.</p>
                                                    <p>In a research project to categorize and identify musical recordings, Scala made a complex processing pipeline look beautiful with its collections. Processing pitches, building musical models, and applying machine learning algorithms could each be implemented as a data transformation.</p>
                                                    <p>On my high school robotics team, I was able to use Scala.js and Akka-HTTP to build a web-based dashboard for viewing live sensor and control loop data, as well as running automated calibration routines. The simplicity of both Scala.js and Akka-HTTP made it easy to send data produced by simple functions to clients over a WebSocket and have clients render the data as it arrives.</p>
                                                    <p>A combination of Akka, Play Framework, and Scala.js built Ash, a home-automation system with easy extensibility. Modeling server and client portions as actors allowed for easy communication between them. Akka also became a unifying factor for working across a diverse set of hardware -- PCs, mobile devices, and Raspberry Pis</p>

                                                    <p>One of the great benefits of the Lightbend ecosystem is its ability to empower great scalability, and it is often considered for this very reason.Indeed, if employed correctly, Scala, Akka and the rest can make it possible to much more easily write systems that scale up (and out) to extremes. However, not every design is able to scale, and the approach and architecture can sharply limit this option, no matter how good the tools. What does ""perfect scalability"" look like? Is there even such a thing? Can systems be designed to scale virtually without limit? Where does the pattern break down, and what can you do about it?</p>
                                                    <p>In this session, we will examine the practical architectural constraints on systems intended to scale up in near-linear fashion. It turns out that having the ability to scale to extreme load is more about what not to do than it is about what to do. Why do some system scale up and others don't? How can you take a design that has problems and refactor to a design that has fewer limits? Our teams encounter these problems every day, and we keep track of what works and what doesn't in the real world. What have we seen in the field? What proven real-world design and architecture approaches can we use to help ensure our systems can scale, and what should we avoid? How can we leverage the power of the Lightbend platform to architect such systems? Which parts for which kinds of problems? How does Akka and the actor model fit these patterns? How does Spark, Kafka, Akka streaming?</p>
                                                    <p>Highly scalable systems often put together tools such as Docker, Ansible, Salt, Mesos, ConductR with techniques such as microservices, monitoring, and continious delivery. Automation of the deploy pipeline and deep performance monitoring are essential parts of highly scalable systems - we will look at examples of such systems, and which of the tools in the stack they employ, and why. In this talk, we'll examine both the practices and the pitfalls, and what combinations we have used to scale not only within single clusters, but across data centers for continent-spanning applications where required.We will use use-cases all the way from massive IoT scale wearable devices all the way to high finance, and find the commonalities in the solutions that don't limit their own expansion. If your organization needs to take your scalability to significantly higher levels, this talk will be where you need to start.</p>

Recognizing that monadic design and development patterns have their place, this talk will discuss the price of implementing the Free Monad in your code - spoiler alert - it's not free. We will define the Free Monad (without using complicated category theory!) and give you the confidence to know when it is and is not the answer in your code. We will also discuss some alternatives and their tradeoffs in maintainability, performance and design.

However the lack of standardized Big Data Scala benchmarks has hindered extended performance improvements related to the datacenter. In this talk we will present a newly developed Scala Big Data Benchmark based on learnings from TCPx-BB, SparkBench, and genomic (GATK/ADAM) workloads. We'll also introduce the most impacting big data-related performance improvements for Scala developed by our group.<br><br> </span></div>

                                                    <p>Stefan Zeiger is the tech lead for Slick. He joined Lightbend in 2011 after developing ScalaQuery, the predecessor to Slick, in order to work on the new project full-time. He has been a user of Java and the JVM platform professionally since 1996, working on a diverse range of projects from web servers to GUI frameworks and programming language design, and moving on from Java to Scala since 2008. He is a frequent speaker at Scala Days and other conferences.</p>

With standard Scala language features we can provide a DSL that allows you to work with database tables using a syntax similar to Scala collections. Of particular interest are abstractions for record types, such as tuples. While earlier versions of Slick had to get by with custom types for all tuple sizes to represent flat tuples of individual columns, the "Shape" abstraction paved the way for using standard Scala tuples in the DSL, with arbitrary nesting. The same abstraction is used to support Slick's own HList implementation, and with only a few lines of code, your own custom record types or other HList implementations. The core language feature behind this design is called "functional dependencies". It was added to Scala in release 2.8 to be able to implement the "CanBuildFrom" abstraction in the new collections framework.</span></div>

Using it in the frontend, however, is a new possibility with the advent of Scala.js. It brings a fresh set of possibilities in combating complexity along with a few new challenges. Modern single-page and mobile apps feature sophisticated functionality, intuitive user experience, and &nbsp;the requirement of working across various browsers and devices. This leads to significant complexity in frontend development; it is not uncommon to spend the majority of development effort on the frontend. &nbsp;For such apps, you need significant machinery to keep code and developers sane! Scala.js offers one such possibility by extending the benefits of Scala to the frontend. There is a movement in JavaScript land to embrace &nbsp;immutability, functional programming, and type safety--something already available in Scala. Combining this trend with good interoperability support in Scala helps to leverage JavaScript libraries in Scala.js projects with reduced philosophical friction. With all these considerations, we decided to use Scala.js for frontend development for our startup. In this talk, I will talk about how this choice has served us and lessons learned in using Scala in every layer of the stack.</div>

                                                    <div style="text-align: left;">Event sourcing is a great alternative to traditional "CRUD"-type architectures. The central concept is a persistent stream of <strong>events</strong>, which drives all changes to the read model and running any kind of business logic. There’s a lot of technical and business benefits to such an approach, such as being able to re-create the state of the system at any point in time, or keeping a detailed *audit log* of all actions. Typically, implementations of event sourcing are presented using a NoSQL data storage, which is great for many use cases (e.g. using Akka Persistence + Cassandra). However, nothing stops us from using a relational database and SQL! In many applications (especially “enterprise”), this brings many benefits, such as powerful and familiar query capabilities and higher guarantees around data consistency. In this mainly <strong>live-coding talk</strong>&nbsp;we’ll see one way of implementing transactional event sourcing using the 'slick-eventsourcing' micro-framework, introducing the core concepts: <strong>command handlers</strong>, <strong>read model updates</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>event listeners</strong>, and how to use them to build an event-sourced application. We’ll see how Slick’s 'DBAction' and Scala flexibility makes it possible to provide an <strong>elegant DSL</strong>&nbsp;to build the system from simple functions with minimum dependencies.</div>

How can each microservice communicate with others in a distributed computing environment to correctly fulfill business objectives? How can my microservices adhere to the tenets of reactive software, being responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven? Using Scala and Akka to implement microservices, this talk will demonstrate how you can implement microservices while answering all of the questions posed, and more. The talk will show you how to carefully craft microservices and to model the business domain within. You will experience advanced use of Akka throughout.</span></div>

                                                    <p>Building a complete system out of individual Microservices is not as simple as we're being told. While Microservices-based Architecture continues to draw more and more attention we're also starting to learn about the trade-offs and drawbacks. Individual Microservices are fairly easy to understand and implement, but they only make sense as systems, and it is in-between the services that the most challenging (and interesting) problems arise—here we are entering the world of distributed systems.</p>
                                                    <p>As we all know, distributed systems are inherently complex and we enterprise developers have been spoiled by centralized servers for too long to easily understand what this really means. Just slicing an existing system into various REST services and wiring them back together again with synchronous protocols and traditional enterprise tools—designed for a monolithic architectures—will set you up for failure.</p>
                                                    <p>This talk is going to distill the essence Microservices-based systems and then introduce you to a new development approach to Microservices which gets you started quickly with a guided, minimalistic approach on your local machine and supports you every single step on the way to a productive scaled out Microservices-based system composed of hundreds of services. At the end of this talk, you've experienced first hand how creating systems of microservices on the JVM is dead-simple, intuitive, frictionless and last and more importantly—a lot of fun!</p>

Besides that one will learn which aspects of language support in IntelliJ IDEA have already been implemented or will be implemented in the near future. Among other things the talk will cover the build process of the project, the incremental compilation.</span></div>

What can I match on? How efficient is it? What do case classes have to do with it? What's an extractor? What's the deal with unapply and unapplySeq? And what exactly is the role of "::" or "+:" when matching sequences? If I build my own extractors, what exactly goes in, what comes out? This is an entry level talk for developers who'd like to look "under the hood" of pattern matching, and who haven't written their own extractors yet.&nbsp;</div>

It was one of the first systems to provide a functional API in Scala and automatically distribute the work over clusters, simplifying distributed programming. In this keynote, I'll talk about how Spark's API has evolved since the first version, and in particular about new APIs in the soon to be released Spark 2.0. The largest additions have been to make the API more declarative, allowing richer automatic optimizations, and to provide a stronger link between Scala data types and a binary data format, enabling memory- and CPU-efficient processing. These ideas may be relevant to other high-performance libraries in Scala.</dd>

People with and without Scala.js knowledge are equally invited. What to expect? Quick yet concise overview of moving Scala.js parts following by presentation of non coast-to-coast approach to Scala.js. Still not convinced to come to the talk? How about:
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>Spoiler #0: There will be no preaching to the choir. Huh? No slides about Javascript vs Scala. We all know the answer, aren't we?
                                                    <br>Spoiler #1: Overview will be based on perks of Scala.js cross project. Crossbuilding knowledge is a power, you will see.
                                                    <br>Spoiler #2: There is a strong presumption that a number of your frontend teammates willing to move to Scala.js is 0. You tell me if I'm wrong, I show you how ""my way or the highway"" is not your only Scala.js option.
                                                    <br>Spoiler #3: It all will start making sense. See you on scala-js gitter.</dd>

                                                    <p>Tim Soethout is a functional programming purist in any language. During his studies, he worked a lot in Haskell using the concepts of Functional Programming. In the enterprise world, Scala is his next interest since it is an ideal mix of mainstream programming and function programming. As a true developer, he does not want to do things twice; automation is key. Lately, he has been focussing on making Scala accessible for everyone inside the enterprise by making sure all road bumps, such as training, tooling and support, are taken care of.</p>

                                                    <p>At the keynote at Scala Exchange, Jessica Kerr mentioned that there is very much documentation for starting and expert Scala developers but (almost) nothing in between. In this talk I want to demystify implicits. Implicits are a fairly advanced feature and a very important aspect of the Scala language. They help with writing concise code and enable lots of DSLs. On the other side, they can be very magical for an untrained eye. In this talk, we will delve into idiomatic use cases of implicits and how the Scala compiler resolves them. If time allows, we will jump into type classes as well.</p>

Starting from the needs that led to this type of processing, we’ll go through the different implementation considerations, jump into an implementation that includes a query parser and an akka cluster to do the processing, and then see how we can produce a stream output of the results. This talk could benefit anyone that is interested in Scala, Akka, Big Data, stream processing and of course graphs.</p>

                                                    <p>Big data and fast data are definitely the buzz words of the last couple of years, but they’re telling us something – people want to get insights out of large amounts of data, whether it’s moving (""fast"") or static. In many companies, and such is the case at Capital One, the basis for generating these insights is data analysis and model building, which requires the ability to get to the data easily.</p>
                                                    <p>Getting the data easily is a major pain point, especially at large enterprises – Imagine, what if you needed to integrate massive amounts of data across hundreds or thousands of different sources and then deliver that data in a variety of formats and in a specific “schema”? Add to that, what if that “schema” can change on a whim based on the needs of the business?</p>
                                                    <p>That’s where Scala, Akka and graphs come in, and specifically their use for integrating data, sourced from multiple locations, and then delivering that integrated data for analysis via queries, APIs and other interfaces in a distributed, stream based and highly efficient manner.</p>
                                                    <p>This talk will start by presenting the need, and then go through an in-depth look at how we took Scala and Akka (Cluster, Remote, Persistence), along with Spark, Kafka, Hbase and other tools to create a graph analysis engine (database) that provides a self-service data computation and delivery platform at Capital One.</p>

It promotes a programming model where servers and clients might be viewed as <a href="http://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf" target="_blank">functions</a>, which are both easy to compose and reason about. Although, there is quite a complex logic (connection pooling, load balancing, circuit breaking and so on) hidden behind those functions. In this talk, we'll dig into Finagle internals and carefully walk through each of its modules to see what happens when we a) send a request to a Finagle client b) receive a request by a Finagle server.</p>

                                                    <p>Processing streaming data is becoming increasingly important in many areas. Scala and the Lightbend Reactive platform offer multiple solutions for processing streaming data, including Akka, Akka Streams and Apache Spark. This talk introduces the advantages and concepts of streaming data processing. It will mention differences between static data and data in motion and their usage as streaming data sources. The main goal of the presentation is detailed discussion of Akka Persistence Query and implementation of the stream production specification in Cassandra plugin for Akka Persistence (akka-persistence-cassandra) that the author participated in. Focus is on architecture and design considerations, implementation details, performance tuning and distributed system specifics such as correctness, efficiency, consistency, order, causality or failure scenario handling that are inherently part of the solution and apply to wide variety of distributed systems. Finally, other improvements to the Cassandra plugin for Akka Persistence project such as reusing the stream generation for non blocking asynchronous Akka Persistence recovery as well as application of the project and the discussed concepts to build modern reactive enterprise stream processing and asynchronous messaging distributed applications are presented.

                                                    <p>Domain Driven Design has been a game changer in my career. &nbsp;Combined with Onion Architecture it has made improvements to my code, in both readability and maintainability.</p>
                                                    <p>Scala is ideally suited to Domain Driven Design. &nbsp;Case classes and traits allow us to rapidly prototype a domain. &nbsp;We can iterate over that domain quickly as we build. This makes it trivial to specify a rich description of a domain with very little code, and minimal investment of time.</p>
                                                    <p>Onion Architecture provides us with the tools needed to create clean package structures. It provides a framework for creating the abstraction layers to allow your code to be portable, testable, and easier to maintain.</p>
                                                    <p>In this code-driven talk, I will explore the techniques I developed while using Domain Driven Design and Onion Architecture in Scala. &nbsp;I will discuss key features such as Repositories, Services, Aggregates, Bounded Contexts and more. I will explore how Onion Architecture can be used with Domain Driven Design to build up applications in fully portable layers.</p>

In this talk, I'll address these questions, using ideas from the philosophy of science. The talk will give new insight into the process of becoming productive in Scala and the mindset needed to aid this process. Using the framework of "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", we can see programming as undergoing three revolutions: Structured programming, object-oriented programming, and now, functional programming. Each revolution brings with a new paradigm - basic assumptions and values that make moving across paradigms difficult to achieve. In this talk, I'll describe the paradigm of the functional programmer: What is valued and what is considered good code. I will contrast this to the paradigm of the object-oriented programmer and finally consider if it is possible to reconcile these two approaches to programming.</p>

                                                    <p>Konrad is a late-night passionate dev living by the motto "Life is Study!". His favourite discussion topics range from distributed systems to capybaras. He has founded and run multiple user groups (Java, Scala, Computer Science, ...), and is part of program committees of awesome conferences such as GeeCON and JavaOne SF. Other than that, he's a frequent speaker on distributed systems and concurrency topics at conferences all around the world. In those rare times he's not coding, he spreads the joy of computer science by helping local user groups and whitepaper reading clubs. He also holds number of titles, the most fun of which being Java One RockStar 2015.</p>

                                                    <p>In order to be successful with asynchronous / reactive programming, when coming from synchronous execution models, you need to change your mindset and look at things from a slightly different perspective. In order to use Akka at it's best, you will have to change the way you think about application design (loosen coupling in space and time between components), and re-think what you've maybe learnt in the past. In this talk we uncover a number of rules that serve as a guide in designing concurrent distributed applications, how those apply to Akka and how they can help you in daily app development.</p>

We will also discuss problems with designing an I/O library that would make everyone happy and different schools of thoughts e.g. monadic vs non-blocking vs effect-based APIs</p>

                                                    <p>In this talk, we are going to discuss various state of the art open-source distributed streaming frameworks, their similarities and differences, implementation trade-offs, their intended use-cases, and how to choose between them. I’m going to focus on the popular frameworks including Spark Streaming, Storm, Samza and Flink. In addition, I'll cover theoretical introduction, common pitfalls, popular architectures and many more.</p>
                                                    <p>The demand for stream processing is increasing. Immense amounts of data has to be processed fast from a rapidly growing set of disparate data sources. This pushes the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include trading, social networks, Internet of things or system monitoring, are becoming more and more important. A number of powerful, easy-to-use open source platforms have emerged to address this. My goal is to provide comprehensive overview about modern streaming solutions and to help fellow developers with picking the best possible decision for their particular use-case. This talk should be interesting for anyone who is thinking about, implementing, or have already deployed streaming solution.</p>

                                                    <p>In ScalaTest 3.0's new async testing styles, tests have a result type of Future[Assertion]. Instead of blocking until a future completes, then performing assertions on the result, you map assertions onto the future and return the resulting Future[Assertion] to ScalaTest. The test will complete asynchronously when the Future[Assertion] completes. This non-blocking way of testing requires a very different mindset and different API. In this talk, Bill Venners will show you how async testing was integrated into ScalaTest and explain what motivated the design decisions. He'll show you how to use the new features, and suggest best practices for async testing on both the JVM and Scala.js.</p>

Jan will then show the most exciting aspects of the Akka and Spark code: The Akka cluster and CQRS to handle the volume of users; the Spark code to compute the models for the users. Naturally, the talk will include the infrastructure code for continuous deployment and monitoring of the entire system. As usual, expect a nerve-wracking live demos! Jan closes with lessons learnt in maintaining and evolving the system, helping you avoid the typical pitfalls in Akka &amp; Spark systems, and hopefully motivating you to "have a go" at designing and implementing similarly complex systems yourselves!</p>

Compiled Scala.js programs typically run on par with equivalent, hand-written JavaScript code. To achieve this, Scala.js features an advanced optimizer. In this talk, we will explore some typical Scala.js code snippets, and see what the optimizer makes of them. In the process, we will give insights about the code patterns that it can optimize away, as well as things it cannot (yet) eliminate. Attendees will take away keys to write efficient Scala.js code. In particular, we will see that idiomatic Scala code is not to be feared (e.g., for loops, or maps/filters). Attendees are expected to be familiar with Scala (not necessarily Scala.js) and to be able to read JavaScript. No compiler knowledge is required; we will stay at the source code level, showing <strong>what</strong>&nbsp;the optimizer does without explaining <strong>how</strong>.</div>

                                                    <p>Typeclasses are a hidden gem of the Scala language. They provide an immense power not seen in imperative languages, and so their approach might be unusual or alien to those approaching Scala from an imperative background. I will show how typeclasses allow developers to effectively attach their own interfaces to code written by others. In this talk, I describe what a genetic algorithm is and provide an example implementation in Scala. Using this implementation, I will demonstrate how to define a specific typeclass for our problem. I will then derive several different implementations, showing how to get rock solid confidence in testing our algorithm - with the help of ScalaCheck - and then provide a completely different typeclass to provide a fun, visual and creative solution, illustrating the iterations and improvements as the genetic algorithm’s fitness function runs. The talk will be particularly hands-on, with plenty of examples run directly from the REPL.</p>

                                                    <p>Transitioning from a monolithic application to a set of microservices can help increase performance and scalability, but it can also drastically increase complexity. Layers of inter-service network calls for add latency and an increasing risk of failure where previously only local function calls existed. In this talk, I'll speak about how to tame this complexity using Apache Kafka and Reactive Streams to:
                                                        <br>- Extract non-critical processing from the critical path of your application to reduce request latency
                                                        <br>- Provide back-pressure to handle both slow and fast producers/consumers
                                                        <br>- Maintain high availability, high performance, and reliable messaging
                                                        <br>- Evolve message payloads while maintaining backwards and forwards compatibility.</p>

                                                    <p>Normally, we use Java or Scala to build applications for large organizations running on servers. We wanted to find out if we could use the same languages and tools on IoT hardware. We also wanted to investigate whether or not (remote) actors could replace REST endpoints. The Lego trains are equipped with a Raspberry Pi, camera, wireless dongle, infrared transmitter, speaker, RFID reader, and battery pack. Next to that, we have automated switch tracks a Lego Ferris Wheel and camera's again with the help of Raspberry Pi's. We also built some lightning effects with LEDs controlled by Particle Photon’s. To control the trains and other parts, we built a remote actor based application with Scala, Akka, Akka HTTP and AngularJS. We will show you when and how to use Akka HTTP and remote actors. We will also show the results of the performance tests we did to compare the two options. Next to that we will talk about our experiences and challenges and of course we will give a live demo!</p>

                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Code of Conduct is inspired by the kind folks at NE Scala, who adopted theirs from PNW Scala. We think they both nailed it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nobody likes a jerk, so please show respect for those around you. This applies to both in-person and online behavior.
                </p>

                    Scala Days is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

                    All communication should be appropriate for a technical audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, innuendo, and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.&nbsp;
