<p>Starting a Scala project should be easy, but with a Simple Build Tool that appears anything but whats the best way to get started and stay sure footed?</p>

<p>In this beginners talk we'll help get you up and running quickly and well on the road to success. In five simple steps you'll be able to release your code to the wild, safe in the knowledge you've set up a good foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>The 5 Steps to a happy project:</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Simple Build Tool (SBT)<br />
   Having a build tool is core to getting started, so let SBT do the work for you.  You might not find it simple, but it doesn't have to be complex.</li>
<li>2. Console management.<br />
   Mastering the REPL is the key to quick debugging / testing of code.</li>
<li>3. Testing<br />
   You need to know your code works and recent changes haven't broken anything.  As with any modern language theres a wealth of choice and we'll have a quick look at most popular two: ScalaTest, Specs2</li>
<li>4. Checks and Balances<br />
   Just because your test suite is green doesn't mean your code is any good. Using ScalaCheck you can conform to style and JaCoC will show you code that is missing tests.</li>
<li>5. Publishing<br />
   Now your code is tested, how do you publish it and share with the world? We'll look at how to set up SBT to publish your code.</li>
